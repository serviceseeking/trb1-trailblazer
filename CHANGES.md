# 1.2.0

## API change:

* Changed `Operation#validate`: the signature now is `validate(params, model=self.model, options={}, contract_class)`.
* Changed `Operation#contract`: the signature now is `contract(model=self.model, options={}, contract_class)`.

Both changes simplify injecting additional dependencies into the contract, or making use of `Composition` contracts. Read more [here](trailblazer.to/gems/operation/contract.html). Note that in 1.2, there are deprecation mechanics to handle old code.

# 1.1.1

* Rename `Operation::Representer::ClassMethods` to `Operation::Representer::DSL` and allow to use `DSL` and `Rendering` without `Deserialization` so you can use two different representers.
* `Policy::Guard::policy` now also accepts a `Callable` object.
* Add `Operation#model=`.

# 1.1.0

* `Representer#represented` defaults to `model` now, not to `contract` anymore.
* The only way to let Trailblazer pass a document to the operation is via `is_document: true`. There is _no guessing_ anymore based on whether or not `Representer` is mixed into the operation or not.
* Add `Operation#params!` that works exactly like `#model!`: return another params hash here if you want to change the `params` structure while avoiding modifying the original one.
* Add `Controller#params!` that works exactly like `Operation#params!` and allows returning an arbitrary params object in the controller. Thanks to @davidpelaez for inspiration.
* Deprecate `Dispatch` in favor of `Callback`. In operations, please include `Operation::Callback`. Also, introduced `Operation#callback!` which aliases to `#dispatch!`. Goal is having to think less, and now all naming is in line.

## Fixes

* `Representer#to_json` now allows passing options.
* The `:params` key never got propagated to `prepopulate!` when using `Controller#form`. This is now fixed.

# 1.0.4

* Fix `Controller#run`, which now returns the operation instance instead of the `Else` object.

# 1.0.3

* Remove unprofessional `puts`, @smathy.

# 1.0.2

* Treat all requests as `params` requests unless the operation has a representer mixed in. If you don't want that, you can override using `is_document: false`. This appears to be the smoothest solution for all.
* In `Controller#form`, the options argument is now passed into `form.prepopulate!(options)`. This allows to use arbitrary options and the `options[:params]` for prepopulation.

# 1.0.1

* Treat `:js` requests as non-document, too.
* `Controller#form` now returns the form object and not the operation.
* In `Controller`, `#form`, `#present`, `#run` and `#respond` now all have the same API: `run(constant, options)`. If you want to pass a custom params hash, use `run Comment::Create, params: {..}`.

# 1.0.0

* All Rails-relevant files are now in the `trailblazer-rails` gem. You have to include it should you be in a Rails environment.
* `Operation[{..}]` is deprecated in favor of `Operation.({..})`.
* `Operation::CRUD` is now `Operation::Model`.
* `Controller#form` now invokes `#prepopulate!` before rendering the view.
* `Controller#present` does not instantiate and assign `@form` anymore.
* The internal `Operation` API has changed from `#initialize()` and `#run(params)` to `#initialize(params)` and `#run`.

# 0.3.4

* Added `Operation::Policy`.
* Added `Operation::Resolver`.

# 0.3.3

* Add `Operation::reject` which will run the block when _invalid_.
* In the railtie, require `trailblazer/autoloading` as I am assuming Rails users want maximum comfort.

# 0.3.2

* Allow to use `#contract` before `#validate`. The contract will be instantiated once per `#run` using `#contract` and then memoized. This allows to add/modify the contract _before_ you validate it using `#validate`.
* New signature for `Operation#contract_for(model, contract_class)`. It used to be contract, then model.

# 0.3.1

* Autoload `Dispatch`.

# 0.3.0

## Changes

* In Railtie, use `ActionDispatch::Reloader.to_prepare` for autoloading, nothing else. This should fix spring reloading.
* Allow `Op#validate(params, model, Contract)` with CRUD.
* Allows prefixed table names, e.g. `admin.users` in `Controller`. The instance variables will be `@user`. Thanks to @fernandes and especially @HuckyDucky.
* Added `Operation::Collection` which will allow additional behavior like pagination and scoping. Thanks to @fernandes for his work on this.
* Added `Operation::collection` to run `setup!` without instantiating a contract. This is called in the new `Controller#collection` method.
* Added `Operation#model` as this is a fundamental concept now.
* Improved the undocumented `Representer` module which allows inferring representers from contract, using them to deserialize documents for the form, and rendering documents.
* Changed `Operation::Dispatch` which now provides imperative callbacks.

## API change

1. The return value of #process is no longer returned from ::run and ::call. They always return the operation instance.
2. The return value of #validate is `true` or `false`. This allows a more intuitive operation body.

    ```ruby
    def process(params)
      if validate(params)
        .. do valid
      else
        .. handle invalid
      end
    end
    ```

* `Worker` only works with Reform >= 2.0.0.

# 0.2.3


# 0.2.2

# Added Operation#errors as every operation maintains a contract.

# 0.2.1

* Added `Operation#setup_model!(params)` that can be overridden to add nested objects or process models right after `model!`. Don't add deserialization logic here, let Reform/Representable do that.
* Added `Operation#setup_params!(params)` to normalize parameters before `#process`. Thanks to @gogogarrett.
* Added `Controller::ActiveRecord` that will setup a named controller instance variable for your operation model. Thanks @gogogarrett!
* Added `CRUD::ActiveModel` that currently infers the contract's `::model` from the operation's model.

# 0.2.0

## API Changes

* `Controller#present` no longer calls `respond_to`, but lets you do the rendering. This will soon be re-introduced using `respond(present: true)`.
* `Controller#form` did not respect builders, this is fixed now.
* Use `request.body.read` in Unicorn/etc. environments in `Controller#respond`.

## Stuff

* Autoloading changed, again. We now `require_dependency` in every request in dev.

# 0.1.3

* `crud_autoloading` now simply `require_dependency`s model files, then does the same for the CRUD operation file. This should fix random undefined constant problems in development.
* `Controller#form` did not use builders. This is fixed now.

# 0.1.2

* Add `crud_autoloading`.

# 0.1.1

* Use reform-1.2.0.

# 0.1.0

* First stable release after almost 6 months of blood, sweat and tears. I know, this is a ridiculously brief codebase but it was a hell of a job to structure everything the way it is now. Enjoy!
